Thank you for coming to the Shiny App website.

This is a Shiny app that is going to be used in order to determine what is going to be the best
vehicle for your long-distance trip.

First, it is best to plan your trip and to pick out the best car possible in order to have the optimal 
budget to fit your needs.

Second, you can select your vehicle based on your preferences such as hp (horsepower), cylinders, transmission, or displacement. 

Third, whent the preferences are selected on the app, it will display your available cars to select from based on your choice.
